Linear Regression demo contains following files with their roles specified:
- `server.py` - A python web server with `/prediction/sound` endpoint which raise request to generate the prediction returns the prediction made by model.
- `ml_algo.model.py`- A file which loads the model into the memory, and predicts the output.
- `lin_reg.ipynb` - It creates the model and save it into the filesystem.
- `airfoil_self_noise.csv` - Dataset for which model needs to be generated.

folder details:
- `model_lin_reg` - Model created in `lin_reg.ipynb` is stored here.
- `spark_warehouse` - Auto generated by spark.
- `metastore_db` - Auto generated by spark to maintain derby db.
- `derby.log` - derby db logs generated by spark.


How to run:
- Install Apache spark.
- Install Pyspark
- Install numpy library.
- set required environment variable.
- Run `lin_reg.ipynb` to generate model.
- Start server:  `python3 server.py`
- Hit an endpoint: `localhost:4000/prediction/sound`
